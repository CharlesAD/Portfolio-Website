        About
        <p>
            I think the thing that drew me closest technology is how 
            it has provided me an outlet to express myself creatively 
            by taking my ideas and turning them into something tangible.
             Technology is what makes the world go around in this day 
             and age and it’s improving the lives of vast amounts of 
             people. I derive great satisfaction from problem-solving 
             and harnessing my creativity. This enthusiasm for technology
              has consistently fuelled my dedication to continuous 
              learning in the field.

        Experience
        <p>
            I began my venture into the world of freelance development 
            with a proactive approach – I started by creating websites 
            for free to cultivate my skills. As I progressed from 
            creating free website projects to working with paying 
            clients, I realised the immense value of hands-on experience
            in refining my skills and navigating client interactions.
            Adding to this journey, my commitment to coding excellence
            was recognized through my selection as one of only ten
            participants in the Rubik Talents coding skills Boot-Camp. 
            This accomplishment, being one of 12 after surpassing
            hundreds of applicants in a rigorous selection process,
            speaks volumes about my distinct capabilities and 
            determination to stand out.

        History
        <p>
            Embracing my background as a professional basketball player 
            and a freelance web designer, I bring a diverse range of 
            skills to my journey as a developer. The discipline and 
            teamwork cultivated on the basketball court have instilled 
            in me the value of collaboration and effective communication.
            Having thrived under high-pressure situations, I am equipped
            to remain composed in the face of coding challenges. 
            Furthermore, my experience in freelance web design has honed
            my leadership abilities and attention to detail, traits that
            I believe are essential for excelling in the world of development. 
            My previous career not only defines me but also enriches my 
            approach to becoming a skilled and adaptable developer.

        Education
        <p>
            I've walked a diverse educational path that's shaped my development
            journey. Armed with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from 
            Brunel University, I've gained a solid grasp of the fundamentals. 
            But it's not just about degrees – I've also powered up my skills 
            through the Rubik Talent Skills Bootcamp Certificate, which added 
            a practical edge to my technical prowess. Learning is a dynamic 
            adventure, and my mix of formal education and specialized training 
            reflects my passion for staying sharp in the ever-evolving world 
            of development.
